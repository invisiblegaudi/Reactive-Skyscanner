# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?
> I used Bootstrap for saving time with glyphs and responsive grid and RxJs for the observer pattern while fetching the data from the server.

### Q) What is the command to start the server?
> (Default) `APIKEY=<key> npm run server`

---

# General:

### Q) How long, in hours, did you spend on the test?
> 6 - 8 hrs. 

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
> Streaming. I wanted to add this and added live streaming of the results from the backend but simply didn't have the time to integrate it into the front-end. RxJs would have worked nicely here merging the data. I also would like to add a loading swirl animation and hover animations.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
> The streaming (uncomplete). I know with just another hour or two I'd have that working. Otherwise, everything is standard although I the speed of the results parsing is quite performant.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
> Adding bootstrap gave some annoying errors. The time-saving was under threat! Some of the fields in the results set were difficult to locate at times.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test or our API, we'd love to hear them.
> The test was nice and straightforward, skyscanner is a very familiar UI! My comment on all tests is that it would be better to have a running open source project you could add to rather then build something never to be used, its such a waste of time for unsuccessful applicants! If your api could spit out properties starting with a lowercase char that'd be nice! I hated mixing them into my results JSON but for speed and conciseness' sake I had to leave them in. - Thanks!
